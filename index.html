    <!-- We can place the script element in both the head and body elements. However, since browsers parse documents from top to bottom, if you place the script element at the top of the document, the browser will first download the script and then parse and render the web page document. Additionally, there are instances where the script needs to interact with the document. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the document has been rendered before parsing the script. For these reasons, we typically position the script element at the end of the body element. -->
