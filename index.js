// Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object oriented programming that enables an object to take on the properties and methods of another object.
// And this makes it easy to reuse code in different parts of an application.

// Here's a real example in the last section we define the circle object with this matter.
// Compute optimum location.
// Now for this discussion let's imagine you were working with a class.
// So let's imagine a circle is a class and not an object.
// I want to explain inheritance in classical terms.
// So we have the circle class with one method to compute optimum location.
// Let's imagine tomorrow we're going to add another class to our application called Square and square
// also needs this method to compute optimal location for knowledge.
// Imagine the implementation of this method is exactly the same across these two different classes.
// You don't want to repeat this implementation because if there is a bug in this implementation we have

// to fix it in multiple places or if we decide to change the implementation and make it better again have
// to repeat this in different places so that's when inheritance comes to rescue.
// We can define a new class called shape with this method there and half circle and square inherit this
// matter from the Shape class.
// Now inheritance we have a few terms that you should be familiar with because I'm going to use this term
// throughout this course and this diagram we refer to the Shape class as the base class or superclass
// or parent class.
// All these terms are exactly the same.
// Different tutorials and different books use different terms.
// In contrast we refer to the circle as the derived class or subclass or child class.
// And finally we refer to the inheritance relationship as is a relationship.

// So we say circle is a shape that this is the classical definition of inheritance.
// But as you know in javascript we don't have classes.
// We only have objects so that's when prototypical inheritance comes in the picture.

// So essentially we have two types of inheritance.
// Classical and prototypical.
// And that's one of the topics for interview questions.
// So what is a prototypical inheritance.
// That's a topic for the next lecture.
