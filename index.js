let x = 10; // =

// These are equivalent
x++; // Increment by 1
x = x + 1; // Same as incrementing by 1

// Addition assignment operator
x += 5; // Same as x = x + 5;

// Multiplication assignment operator
x *= 5; // Same as x = x * 5;

// All of the arithmetic operators can be combined with the assignment operator.
