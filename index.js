// There are two types of programming languages:
// - Static (Statically-typed): In these languages, we declare the type of a variable, and once set, it cannot change in the future.
// - Dynamic (Dynamically-typed): In these languages, the type of variables can change during runtime.

// JavaScript is a dynamic language.

let name = "Zahra";
console.log(typeof name); // string
name = 1;
console.log(typeof name); // number
let firstName = undefined;
console.log(typeof firstName); // undefined - the type and value of this variable is undefined.
let selectedColor = null;
console.log(typeof selectedColor); // object
